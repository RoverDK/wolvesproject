        <p>How do you see the future of wolves in the Białowieża Forest, and how might the ecosystem change in the near future?
          Białowieża Forest is quite safe for wolves, especially because it's a UNESCO World Heritage site. This provides a level of protection for both the wolves and their natural habitat. As for the future, the ecosystem here is quite stable, but as the population of wolves grows, we may see more interaction with humans, which could lead to increased conflicts. We may also see wolves pushing into new territories as the forest reaches its capacity for supporting their population.
          
          What is your opinion on the fences installed at the borders, which animals cannot cross, and the corridors for animals that don’t seem to work very well?
          These barriers are problematic. They are not effective at all, and in fact, they are more harmful than helpful. They prevent genetic exchange between wolf populations, which leads to inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity. This has a long-term impact on the health of the species. The corridors intended to help animals move freely don’t work well either—they are often too narrow and poorly designed, limiting wildlife movement.

        <p>Since we are creating a guidebook for tourists, it is important for us to learn how people should behave in the wild. Most of the people do not know anything about wolves or wildlife, what should they do if they meet a single wolf or an entire pack? Can you offer any advice?
          First of all, never run away if you encounter a wolf. Wolves usually avoid humans, and a running person might provoke them to chase. Instead, stay calm and try to enjoy the moment—it’s a rare and unique opportunity to see a wolf. If you encounter a pack, the best approach is to remain still and allow them to pass without disturbing them. Wolves are naturally cautious of humans, and they will likely run away if they feel threatened.Do you believe we can compare the forest to a human's home, where the forest is a kind of home for wolves and we should behave as respectful guests there?
          Absolutely. The forest is like their home, and we, as visitors, should treat it as such. Just as we respect others' homes, we should respect the wolves’ territory. Marking their territory, for example by peeing, stretching, or even digging, is part of their natural behavior. It’s important that we don’t disrupt or intrude on this by crossing boundaries or disturbing them.
          
          The comparison between wolves and dogs has been going on for years. What are the main differences between them? Is it possible to confuse them, and can they be compared to one another at all?
          There is one breed of dog—the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog—that resembles a wolf quite closely. But generally, wolves are much larger than dogs and weigh significantly more. Wolves also have a much stronger and more powerful build. In terms of behavior, wolves are far more independent and wild, while dogs have been domesticated to live alongside humans. So, although there are similarities, the differences are more striking when you look at their size, behavior, and evolutionary roles.</p>

        <p>What are your thoughts on the future of wolves in Białowieża Forest and the surrounding ecosystem?
          The wolves in Białowieża Forest have been able to thrive due to the protection of the forest as a UNESCO site. It offers a sanctuary where they can live relatively undisturbed. However, as human-wolf interactions increase, so will the potential for conflicts, particularly with livestock. The forest's ecosystem has remained resilient, but more work needs to be done to ensure that wolves can live in balance with the local human population.
          
          How do you view the installation of fences and corridors for animal movement, especially regarding their effectiveness for wolves?
          The fences and animal corridors have not been as effective as hoped. While the intention was to create safe passages for wildlife, they often fail because they don’t offer the necessary space or the proper environment. Wolves are especially affected because they need vast territories to roam. These barriers prevent genetic diversity from being maintained and can trap animals, which has a negative impact on their long-term survival.

        <p>Regarding the behavior of tourists encountering wolves, how should they act in such situations?
          If someone meets a single wolf or a pack, they should not panic. As I mentioned, wolves tend to avoid humans. If you're lucky enough to see one, it’s a beautiful moment, so embrace it and respect their space. The key is to stay calm, avoid sudden movements, and never approach the wolves. If the pack is near, just stay still and watch from a safe distance. Most importantly, don’t try to provoke or chase them.
          
          What are your thoughts on the idea of considering the forest as a wolf's home and respecting their space as guests?
          That’s an excellent way of thinking about it. The forest is the wolves’ home, and we are the visitors. They have their boundaries, and we need to be aware of that. Just as we wouldn’t intrude in someone's home, we need to respect their territory. Wolves have natural behaviors like marking their territory through scent marking and digging, and we must allow them to do so without interference.
          
          Do you think there are ways to educate the public about wolves, their behavior, and the importance of coexisting with them?
          Education is key. Many people misunderstand wolves and fear them. If we provide clear and accessible information about their role in the ecosystem, their behavior, and how to safely interact with them, we can reduce fear and promote coexistence. It’s also essential to stress the importance of preserving their habitat and respecting their natural boundaries.
          
          Final Thoughts
          Both experts emphasize the importance of respecting wolves and their environment. Whether you are a tourist visiting Białowieża Forest or someone looking to understand the role of wolves in the ecosystem, it's clear that education, respect, and understanding are the keys to ensuring that wolves continue to thrive. By teaching visitors not to fear wolves but to appreciate them as essential parts of the forest ecosystem, we can help foster a future where humans and wolves coexist harmoniously.</p>
