        <p>Ecosystem Connected to Wolves
            Past
            Resurgence of Wolves in the 1980s: Wolves naturally reappeared in the Białowieża Forest 
            after being absent since the early 20th century. Their return played a significant role in 
            restoring ecological balance, as they helped regulate populations of ungulates like deer and wild boar, 
            thereby controlling vegetation growth and maintaining a balanced ecosystem.
            Present
            Role of Wolves as Key Predators: Wolves maintain ecological balance by controlling herbivore populations,
             which prevents overgrazing and supports forest vegetation and biodiversity.
            Future Predictions
            Increased Mortality and Population Fragmentation: Due to the border fence and hunting pressures, 
            wolf populations could face significant genetic isolation, which might increase mortality rates
             and reduce genetic diversity. This could weaken their role as ecological regulators, potentially 
             leading to ecosystem degradation if wolf numbers decline too drastically.</p>

        <p>Ecosystem Connected to Human Activity
            Past
            Hunting Regulations in 2010: Legalization of wolf hunting led to a population decline, 
            disrupting ecological balance by allowing ungulate populations to increase. This contributed
             to vegetation damage and altered the territorial and behavioral patterns of wolves, causing 
             them to be more cautious and adaptive.
            Present
            Logging Activities: Polish government logging, aimed at addressing bark beetle infestations,
             is fragmenting the forest and degrading habitats, especially old-growth areas crucial for wolves.
             This disruption reduces wolves' ability to establish territories and locate prey, impacting the overall forest ecosystem.
            Border Fence Construction: The construction of a border fence between Poland and Belarus has severely 
            impacted wildlife, blocking migration routes and fragmenting habitats. The fence poses a physical 
            barrier for wolves and other animals, decreasing biodiversity by isolating populations and impacting gene flow.
            Future Predictions
            Strengthening of Border Fence and Increased Mortality: As the Polish government enhances the fence,
             experts predict increased mortality rates among wildlife. Over the next one to two years, this may 
             further harm biodiversity, exacerbate genetic isolation, and potentially endanger already vulnerable
              species. The continuation of logging and hunting policies, if unmitigated, could further harm the forest's 
              ecological stability.</p>

        <p>Ecosystem Connected to Both Wolves and Human Activity
            Past
            Human-Wildlife Conflicts due to Hunting and Population Changes: With fewer wolves due to hunting, 
            ungulate populations increased, leading to conflicts as wolves searched for food near human settlements
             and began preying on livestock. This change complicated conservation efforts and altered the human relationship
              with wolves.
            Present
            Human-Wildlife Conflicts due to Fence and Logging Impacts: As logging and the border fence push wolves 
            closer to human populations, incidents of wolves hunting livestock and venturing into rural areas are increasing.
             This complicates conservation management and adds tension between protecting wolves and addressing community concerns.
            Negative Ecosystem Effects due to Border Fence: UNESCO experts have identified ecological disruptions in 
            Belovezhskaya Pushcha due to the border fence. Species overpopulation in some areas, decline in others, 
            and food chain imbalances have been observed, leading to biodiversity losses across the ecosystem.
            Future Predictions
            Potential Endangerment of Species and Ecosystem Degradation: With continued construction and strict management
             of the border fence, biodiversity losses are expected to worsen. Wolf populations may become more isolated, 
             leading to endangerment concerns. If the ecosystem continues to fragment, broader ecological collapse could
              follow, with more species potentially becoming threatened or endangered.</p>
