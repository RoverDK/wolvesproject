        <p>History of Wolves 
            The wolf in Poland experienced dramatic population changes post-WWII. In the 1950s, the communist 
            regime initiated an intensive eradication program, offering bounties and using poisoning and hunting 
            to nearly exterminate wolves. By 1972, only 60 wolves remained, confined to the eastern and southeastern regions.
            In 1975, wolves were reclassified as game animals, halting their extermination. However, despite the 
            Berne Convention of 1979 protecting wolves across Europe, Poland obtained an exemption, allowing 
            continued persecution. By 1994, the population had recovered to around 850, though still absent west of the Vistula River.
            Since 1998, wolves have been under strict protection in Poland. In 1998, the Environment Ministry 
            granted strict protection to wolves across Poland, allowing their gradual recovery and westward recolonization.
            This was further enhanced in 2004 with Poland’s EU accession and the adoption of the Habitats Directive, 
            which mandated that each wolf subpopulation be managed for favorable conservation status.
            As a result, Poland’s three wolf populations are now thriving and reaching sustainable levels.</p>

        <p>The Bialowieża Forest wolf population
            There are four wolf families (packs) in the Polish part of Białowieża Forest. 
            The number of wolves in each pack varies from year to year – depending on how may pups are born, 
            and how many of these survive. Packs generally have 5-10 wolves – and so the population on the 
            Polish side of the forest numbers 20-40 wolves. This may seem like a relatively small number, 
            but in fact this seems to be the carrying capacity of the Polish part of the forest. 
            Each family occupies around 200 km2, and defends this territory from other wolves.                   
            The wolf population on the Polish side of Białowieża Forest is remarkably stable. 
            The population size and the distributions of the four wolf pack territories has more or less 
            stayed the same for over 20 years. Now of course, the individuals within those packs have changed 
            (wolves live up to 8-10 years in the wild). Interestingly, before this stable state emerged, 
            a curious event happened. There used to be just one pack living in the south of the forest. 
            But this family split in two – that’s why the two packs inhabiting this part of the forest, 
            and which live side-by-side, are called the Leśna I and Leśna II packs. Since this split we’ve had four wolf 
            families in the forest.</p>

        <p>Key Observations for Comparative Analysis
            Population Inversion and Recovery: In the early centuries, wolf populations were high due to limited human interference, 
            but as human settlements increased, wolf numbers declined dramatically. By the mid-20th century, wolves were 
            near extinction due to hunting policies, while human populations steadily grew.
            Modern Conservation Impact: Since conservation efforts began in the late 20th century, wolf populations have 
            rebounded significantly, though they remain lower than historical levels. Human populations have remained stable, 
            with locals increasingly involved in conservation and eco-tourism rather than hunting.
            Human Attitude Shift: Attitudes have shifted from eradication to appreciation of wolves as integral to the ecosystem, 
            with wolves now viewed as an important part of the forest’s biodiversity and a draw for eco-tourism.
            This analysis reflects the broader ecological importance of wolves in Białowieża and shows how human activities 
            and attitudes directly impacted the wolf population, offering a clear basis for comparing population trends 
            and conservation impacts.</p>
